# distributions
Python package that calculates gaussian and binomial distribution metrics. Developed as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program.

# Installation
The following libraries are required: 
- math
- matplotlib

# Project Motivation and Summary
This code demonstrates basic principles of object oriented programming:
 - how to define classes with attributes and methods
 - how a class can inherit attributes from a parent class
 - how to enable operations on class-based objects using magic methods
 - how to combine several modules into a unified Python package

# File Descriptions
- Binomialdistribution.py: defines the Binomial class
- Gaussiandistribution.py: defines the Gaussian class
- Generaldistribution.py: defines the Distribution class, which is inherited by the Binomial and Gaussian classes
